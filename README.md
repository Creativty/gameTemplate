# About

A very basic game template for projects that use *[Haxe](https://haxe.org)* and *[Heaps](https://heaps.io)*
Much of the code is from *[deepnight/gameBase](https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase)*.

# Dependencies

- `hlsdl` git branch (1,12,0).
- `heaps` git branch. (1,9,1).
- `deepnightLibs` git branch (1,72,0).

# Usage

1. Compile using `haxe build.hxml`
2. Run using `hl bin/main.hl`

# Notes

- Has been tested only on Linux & Windows via Hashlink
- Only `hlsdl` has been used during development, However `hlxd` and `javascript` should work according to *[deepnight/gameBase](https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase)*.
- I decided to drop the multiple-languages support for now as it is kind of a hassle to deal with.
